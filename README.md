## What is this?

This is not meant to be a replacement for `rust-tools.nvim`. It does *not* offer all of the capabilities that `rust-tools.nvim` offers nor will it ever do so. 

Instead it simply provides inlay hints in the style of `coc.nvim` for users relying on `rust-analyzer`.

## Why not just use `rust-tools.nvim`?

If you are trying to turn neovim into an IDE-like environment then this plugin is not for you. I happen to fall in the camp of those who prefer to use neovim as a *text-editor*.

Inlay hints were the only thing I needed from the set of features offered by `rust-tools.nvim` hence this plugin provides *exactly* that.
